//task one: Instantiate a 2-D array gridNums that consists of 4 rows and 6 columns using the new keyword. 

//task two: Instantiate a 2-D array with the following values:


//For the following problems, print out those elements before and after to verify it worked. 

//task three: For both of those arrays, change the element in the first row, first column to a 17.

//task four: For both of those arrays, change the element in the second row, third column into a 20. 

//task five: For both of those arrays, change the last element in the first row to a -5. Accomplish this using .length 

//task six: For both of those arrays, change the first element in the last row to a -7. Accomplish this using .length 

//task seven: For both of those arrays, change the last element in the last row to a -30. Accomplish this using .length 

//task eight: Create a method that is passed a 2-D array of ints and one by one prints out each element in the first row. 

//task nine: Create a method that is passed a 2-D array of ints and one by one prints out each element in the first column.

//task ten: Create a method that is passed a 2-D array of ints and one by one prints out each element in row-major order.
