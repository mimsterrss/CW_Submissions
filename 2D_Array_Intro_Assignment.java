//task one: Instantiate a 2-D array gridNums that consists of 4 rows and 6 columns using the new keyword. 

int[][] gridNumsOne = new int[4][6];



//task two: Instantiate a 2-D array with the following values:

int[][] gridNumsTwo = {4, 5, 7},

//task three: For both of those arrays, change the element in the first row, first column to a 17.

//task eight: Create a method that is passed a 2-D array of ints and one by one prints out each element in the first row. 

//task nine: Create a method that is passed a 2-D array of ints and one by one prints out each element in the first column.
